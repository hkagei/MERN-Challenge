# MERN-Challenge

## Description

To build this app, I used a Google Books API to create a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. I have also implemented a MERN stack to create the app. A user can create a new account, log into an existing account, search for their favorite books, add their favorites to a list of saved books, and remove saved books.

## Tools Used
